# LibraryManagementSystem

I made this as a school project

This is a library management system that uses TKINTER for GUI, MYSQL for database on windows and MARIADB for database on linux, and python as the programming language.

(Very Short Project, I must say.)

PS:I plan to add many more features to this project. Example: Themes for the window, more features to make it more usable in an actual library etc...
